PROJECT BACKGROUND
The project aimed to create a real-time task management app that allowed users to sign up, log in, and update tasks in real-time across all devices. The backend functionality relied on Firebase services, including Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database, requiring hands-on experience in secure user data handling. The frontend used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, primarily in VS Code, with the Firebase SDK and Firebase Hosting being essential components. Challenges included ensuring seamless real-time task synchronization and deploying the project using Firebase Hosting. The project provided valuable insights into end-to-end web development, real-time data synchronization, and the use of development tools like VS Code and Firebase.

DISCUSSION
Learning Firebase Console and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as a student. Firebase simplifies backend development with features like real-time databases, authentication, and cloud functions. The user-friendly Firebase Console allows for easy project creation, but understanding configuration files and setting up environment variables can be overwhelming. VS Code, on the other hand, is a new tool that simplifies development with extensions like Prettier, ESLint, and Firebase Tools. Integrating Firebase into a project using VS Code was challenging, as it required working with the terminal and learning commands like firebase init and deploy. Despite the challenges, the author finds the most rewarding part of the journey being seeing their projects come to life.
